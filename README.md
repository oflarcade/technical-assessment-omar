## Details on my submission 

So After creating multiple components to fullufill the requirements needed, I added vitest to the codebase and created a test folder to house the same folder structure to facilitate easy travers of the folder structure.


I didn't manage to connect to the api in the same way as for pokemon due to me not working before with @tanstack/vue-query package, and in order to respect the timing giving to me I created a different way in the composables folder to fetch Rick and Morty characters.

I also wasn't able to finish all the test as well :/
