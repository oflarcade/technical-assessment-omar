# Tech Assessment

## For the Role of Software Engineer at Visma | ProActive

This repository contains an installation of [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) with a simple layout and a few pages. It also includes a couple of modules, one of which connects to the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/).

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate your skills in software development. We are looking for a candidate who can write clean, maintainable code and has a good understanding of the technologies used in this project.

Please don't spend more than 5 hours on this assessment. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but we want to see how you approach the problem and how you solve it. If you don't have time to finish all the tasks, that's fine. Just submit what you have done.

## Task

Connect to an additional API: the Rick and Morty API. Display a list of characters from the Rick and Morty universe. The list should be displayed on a new page, `/rick-and-morty`. Each character should be displayed with their name, species, and an image. When clicking on a character, the user should be taken to a new page, `/rick-and-morty/:id`, where they can see more details about the character.

## Character List Feature Specs

- Display a list of characters
- Allow users to toggle between a grid and list view

## Requirements

- **Add unit tests** using Vitest. Research and implement Vitest within this code stack to ensure your code is well-tested.

## Bonus Points

- Add a search bar to filter characters by name

## Submission

Please submit your solution by forking this repository. Once you have completed your changes, share the link to your forked repository with us. The submission should include a description of the changes you made and instructions on how to run the project locally.

Please email your submission before Thursday, June 20. We will assess and call you on Thursday, 11 to give you feedback and for a follow-up.

Good luck! ðŸš€
